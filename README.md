Getting Started üöÄ
------------------

### Prerequisites

-   Android Studio
-   Firebase Project
-   SHA-1 and SHA-256 certificates for Google Sign-In

### Firebase Setup

1.  Add your Firebase configuration:
    -   Add SHA-1 and SHA-256 certificates to Firebase project for Google Sign-In:

        bash

        Copy

        `# Debug SHA-1 and SHA-256
        cd android && ./gradlew signingReport`

    -   Add the certificates to Firebase Console under Project Settings > Your Apps > SHA certificate fingerprints

    -   Yelp API key is already configured in the project
    -   Update `local.properties` with Google Maps API key (if needed):

2.  Build and run the project in Android Studio

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

-   If Google Sign-In isn't working:
    -   Verify SHA-1 and SHA-256 are correctly added to Firebase Console
    -   Ensure `google-services.json` is up to date
    -   Check if the package name matches Firebase configuration
